Hi, I'm Yujin. I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in statistics at Stanford, advised by Emily Fox and Ramesh Johari. My research interests are in causal inference and distribution shifts. I am grateful to be supported by the [Stanford Data Science Scholarship](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs).

Prior to joining Stanford, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Mathematical Sciences from Seoul National University (SNU).
